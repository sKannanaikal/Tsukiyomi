## Note
This was based on the rootkit developed throughout the multi blog series written by the xcellerator you should check it out.  This was mainly a learning experience meant to get my hands dirty working with and developing the linux kernel.

## Disclaimer
Do not use this for malicious purposes use it to educate yourself and learn more about the world of computers.  If you do though use it for malicious intent I hold no responsibility for the actions be warned cyber crime is really serious and can land you behind bars for a while.

## More Disclaimers
The specific code here is not creatively generated by myself.  I was reading through a series of blog posts made by an individual dubbed xcellerator you can find it here: https://xcellerator.github.io/posts/.  I wanted to get my feet wet and learn abou the world of linux kernel hacking and what better way than to make malicious kernel modules.  I built these up using the content he explained in the blog posts I even made use of his helpful ftrace header file for installing function hooks.  I would like to emphasize although I didn't simply just copy and paste this code I was following along with his guides so the code and ideas are still his.

## Project Overview & Purpose
This was simply a project meant to give me more experience building out and working with the Linux Kernel.  Overall this project successfully gave me that opportunity.  I was able to see the inner workings of many aspects of the linux kernel and finally was able to wrap my head around the famous "Everything is a file in Linux" statement and how that can be used. Albeit I am no expert, and this project has shown me that I have a long ways to go in red teaming and pentesting before I can make something of this caliber on my own, but nonetheless it has inspired me to keep pushing forward until I too can create malicious programs like this.

## Examples

### elevating privlieges

### hiding directories

### hiding kernel modules

### hiding ports

### processes

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. a linux based environment to deploy to

### Installation
If you have make installed you can simply change the obj-m value in the Makefile to the desired kernel module you would like to compile and then after compiling simply load the kernel object into the kernel via the insmod command.

### Issues and Disadvantages
This is an older style of rootkits which can be noticecd via memory analysis so it is not foolproof.  There are more advanced and modern rootkits that far surpass these basic kernel modules here.  Furthermore with the dawn of secure boot and making use of signed drivers there will be many warning signs available to know that a malicious kernel module has been loaded in.  Most of all this requires sudo privlieges to even get loaded into the kernel.  

## Closing Thoughts
I would really appreciate any helpful tips on improving this and thoughts on the program itself.
